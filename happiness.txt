Happiness is not the absence of problems, itâ€™s the ability to deal with them.

- Steve Maraboli


Happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind.

- Thomas Jefferson

Happiness is always a by-product. It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be glandular. But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness.

- Robertson Davies

The secret of happiness is to find a congenial monotony.

- V.S. Pritchett
